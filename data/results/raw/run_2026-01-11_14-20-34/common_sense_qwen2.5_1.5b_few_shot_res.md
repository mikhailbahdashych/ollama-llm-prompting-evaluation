Sure, let's break down each question for Sarah, Tom, and Lisa:

### 1. Sarah left her ice cream on the kitchen counter and went to her room for 2 hours on a hot summer day. When she came back, what most likely happened to the ice cream? Why?

**Answer:**
The most likely thing that happened to the ice cream is it melted completely.

**Reasoning:**
- On a hot summer day, even with a closed kitchen door and no refrigerator nearby, the temperature outside can quickly warm up.
- Sarah left for 2 hours, which could be quite long considering she was on a hot day. The heat would cause the ice cream to melt into liquid milk, not just partially thawing it.

### 2. Tom wants to hang a heavy picture frame on his wall. He has: a hammer, nails, tape, and glue. Which tool(s) should he use and why? What would happen if he used the wrong tool?

**Answer:**
Tom should use a hammer and nails to hang the picture frame.

**Reasoning:**
- A hammer is necessary because it’s an essential tool for breaking through nails or screw heads.
- Nails are required because they securely hold up the heavy picture frame on the wall.

### 3. Lisa is running late for an important meeting across town. She sees two routes: one is shorter (15 minutes) but goes through the city center during rush hour, the other is longer (25 minutes) but uses the highway. Which route should she choose and why? Consider what factors matter in this decision.

**Answer:**
Lisa should choose to use the highway for her trip across town.

**Reasoning:**
- The highway typically offers faster travel times because it bypasses heavy traffic areas.
- Rush hour on the city center road means longer travel time due to increased congestion and delays caused by heavier vehicles and people in the area.
- By choosing the highway, she can save valuable time that might be needed for her meeting or further activities.

### 3. Provide your answers with clear common sense reasoning.

This approach of breaking down and explaining each step involves applying knowledge about how things behave under different conditions, which is what common-sense reasoning primarily entails.
