**Answer 1: Sarah's Ice Cream**

Sarah most likely left her ice cream out on the kitchen counter for two hours during a hot summer day. Given the warm environment and exposure to direct sunlight, the ice cream would have melted or softened due to the heat. The process of melting is more likely than any significant hardening under these conditions.

**Answer 2: Tom Hanging a Picture Frame**

Tom should use **hammers, nails, tape**, and possibly **glue** for safety and stability:

- **Hammer/Nails**: Essential for securing the frame with nails into the wall.
- **Tape**: Helps keep the frame steady while hanging to prevent it from moving or falling.
- **Glue**: Can be used if additional adhesion is needed, such as attaching a mount on another surface.

If Tom uses tools incorrectly, potential issues include:
- **Insufficient nails** without glue may lead to the frame coming loose after hanging.
- **Forgetting tape** could result in the frame falling out of place once hung.

**Answer 3: Lisa's Route Choice**

Lisa should choose the longer route via the highway. While it takes longer (25 minutes), this route likely avoids rush hour congestion, which can significantly increase travel time during peak hours. The shorter city center route may have delays due to heavy traffic, making the highway a more efficient choice despite the extra driving time.

**Summary:**

1. **Sarah's Ice Cream**: Most likely melted or softened.
2. **Tom's Tools**: Use hammer, nails, tape; avoid incorrect tools for safety and stability.
3. **Lisa's Route**: Choose the longer highway route to avoid rush hour congestion.
