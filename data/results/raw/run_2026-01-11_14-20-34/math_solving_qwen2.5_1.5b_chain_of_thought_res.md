### Problem 1: Sarah's Garden Dimensions

**Step 1:** Let \( w \) be the width of the garden in meters.

Given:
- The length is \( 3 + 2w \) meters.
- The perimeter \( P = 36 \) meters.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]

Substitute given values:
\[ 36 = 2(3w + 3) + 2w \]
\[ 36 = 6w + 6 + 2w \]
\[ 36 = 8w + 6 \]

**Step 2:** Solve for \( w \):
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 30 = 8w \]
Divide by 8:
\[ w = 3.75 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 3:** Calculate the length using \( l = 3 + 2w \):
\[ l = 3 + 2(3.75) \]
\[ l = 3 + 7.5 \]
\[ l = 10.5 \text{ meters} \]

**Answer:**
The dimensions of Sarah's garden are:
- Width (\( w \)): 3.75 meters
- Length (\( l \)): 10.5 meters

### Problem 2: Jacket Discounted Price

**Step 1:** Start with the original price of $120.

**Step 2:** Calculate the first discount (25% off):
\[ 120 \times (1 - 0.25) = 120 \times 0.75 \]
\[ 90 \]

**Step 3:** Apply the additional 10% discount on the new price:
\[ 90 \times (1 - 0.10) = 90 \times 0.90 \]
\[ 81 \]

**Answer:**
The final price of the jacket is $81.

### Problem 3: f(4)

Given \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 \), substitute \( x = 4 \):

**Step 1:** Calculate \( x^2 \):
\[ (4)^2 = 16 \]

**Step 2:** Multiply by the coefficient of \( x \) (which is -5):
\[ 16 \times (-5) = -80 \]

**Step 3:** Add this to the constant term:
\[ -80 + 3 = -77 \]

**Answer:**
The value of \( f(4) \) is **-77**.
