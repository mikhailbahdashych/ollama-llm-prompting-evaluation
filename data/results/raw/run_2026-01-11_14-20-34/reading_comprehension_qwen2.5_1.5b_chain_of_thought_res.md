### Step 1: Understand the Question
The task requires analyzing a passage about neuroplasticity and providing answers to specific questions based on the information provided.

### Step 2: Address Each Part of the Question
#### Part 1: Traditional Scientific View vs. Neuroplasticity Understanding
- **Traditional View:** The traditional view was that after childhood, neural pathways in the brain were set in stone by early adulthood.
- **Change from Traditional to Neuroplasticism:** Research over the past three decades has shown that the brain remains remarkably adaptable throughout life, and new neural connections can form and existing ones can be strengthened.

#### Part 2: Evidence Supporting Neuroplasticity
The passage provides several examples of how neuroplasticity is supported:
- **Language Learning Example:** Adults learning a second language show measurable changes in brain structure with increased gray matter in language-processing regions.
- **Stroke Rehabilitation Example:** Stroke patients who engage in intensive therapy can regain lost functions, suggesting that undamaged parts of the brain take over roles previously used by damaged areas.

#### Part 3: Limitation of Neuroplasticity
The passage mentions a limitation:
- "The potential for change extends far beyond what was previously thought possible."

### Step 3: Provide Your Answer
Now let's answer each part based on the information given:

1. **Traditional Scientific View vs. Neuroplasticity Understanding:**
   - The traditional scientific view held that after childhood, neural pathways in the brain were set and fixed.
   - Neuroplasticity challenges this by showing that the brain is adaptable throughout life and can physically change to form new connections.

2. **Evidences Supporting Neuroplasticity:**
   - Adults learning a second language show measurable changes in brain structure with increased gray matter in language-processing regions (e.g., areas involved in reading, writing, and speaking).
   - Stroke patients who engage in intensive therapy can regain lost functions by using undamaged parts of the brain for roles previously used by damaged areas.

3. **Limitation of Neuroplasticity:**
   - The passage indicates that while neuroplasticity is extensive, it has limitations:
     - Age and severity of injury play important roles.
     - Other factors also influence this potential change (e.g., environment, type of therapy).

### Conclusion
By carefully reading the passage and analyzing each part systematically, we can provide accurate answers to the given questions.
