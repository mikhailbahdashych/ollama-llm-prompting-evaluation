### 1. Sarah left her ice cream on the kitchen counter and went to her room for 2 hours on a hot summer day. When she came back, what most likely happened to the ice cream? Why?

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Sarah left her ice cream on the kitchen counter.
   - She stayed in the kitchen for 2 hours.

2. **Consider possible scenarios:**
   - The ice cream could melt due to the warm weather.
   - The heat might cause it to deteriorate or spoil over time.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Sarah left her ice cream on the kitchen counter and stayed in the same environment for 2 hours, it is most likely that the temperature of the room rose significantly during those hours.
   - This could lead to the ice cream melting entirely if not refrigerated properly or partially deteriorating due to excessive heat.

**Conclusion:**
The most likely outcome is that Sarah's ice cream melted because of the high ambient temperature in her kitchen over the 2-hour period.
