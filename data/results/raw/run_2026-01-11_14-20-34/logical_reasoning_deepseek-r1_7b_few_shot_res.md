**a) Conclusion: Maria takes calculated risks**

Yes, we can conclude that Maria takes calculated risks.

**Explanation:**
From premise 3, Maria is a successful entrepreneur. According to premise 1, all successful entrepreneurs take calculated risks. Therefore, by logical deduction (modus ponens), since Maria is an SE, she must take calculated risks.

**b) Conclusion: We cannot conclude that Maria has failed in her ventures**

No, we cannot conclusively determine that Maria has failed in her ventures.

**Explanation:**
Premise 2 states that some people who take calculated risks fail. However, this does not mean all CR individuals fail. Since Maria is a successful entrepreneur and thus takes calculated risks (from premise 1), she might be among those who fail or succeed. There's no information indicating whether Maria specifically failed.

**c) Conclusion: No, someone learning valuable lessons does not necessarily mean they failed in their ventures**

No, failing is not a necessary condition for learning valuable lessons.

**Explanation:**
Premise 4 tells us that everyone who fails learns lessons (F → LL). However, this does not imply that only those who fail learn lessons. It's possible to learn lessons without failing. Therefore, learning lessons can occur through other means besides failure.
