  "prompt": "This task evaluates the model's ability to accurately recall factual information, provide specific and verifiable details, and demonstrate knowledge across different domains while distinguishing between certainty and uncertainty.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: Question: What is the capital of Australia, and why do people often incorrectly think it's Sydney?\nOutput: The capital of Australia is Canberra, not Sydney.\n\nCanberra was purpose-built as the capital and officially became the capital in 1913. It's located in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), which was created specifically to house the nation's capital.\n\nPeople often incorrectly think Sydney is the capital because:\n1. Sydney is Australia's largest and most internationally well-known city\n2. Sydney is the capital of New South Wales, the most populous state\n3. Sydney is a major cultural and economic hub with iconic landmarks (Opera House, Harbour Bridge)\n4. Many countries have their largest city as the capital, leading to this assumption\n\nHowever, similar to Washington D.C. in the United States or Bras\u00edlia in Brazil, Australia chose to create a planned capital city in a neutral location between the rival cities of Sydney and Melbourne.\nExplanation: This provides the correct factual answer with specific details, explains the historical context, and addresses why the misconception exists, showing deeper knowledge beyond just naming the capital.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: Question: How many planets are in our solar system, and has this number changed?\nOutput: There are currently 8 recognized planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (in order from the Sun).\n\nThis number did change in 2006. Previously, there were 9 planets, including Pluto. However, in August 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined what constitutes a planet. Under the new definition, a celestial body must:\n1. Orbit the Sun\n2. Have sufficient mass for self-gravity to make it round\n3. Have \"cleared the neighborhood\" around its orbit\n\nPluto failed the third criterion because its orbit overlaps with other objects in the Kuiper Belt. It was reclassified as a \"dwarf planet,\" along with Eris, Makemake, Haumea, and Ceres.\n\nSo the answer changed from 9 to 8 planets, not because we discovered Pluto wasn't there, but because we refined our definition of what a planet is.\nExplanation: This provides the accurate current number, explains the historical change, gives specific details about when and why the change occurred, and demonstrates understanding of the scientific reasoning behind the reclassification.\n\nNow solve this:\nAnswer the following factual questions with accurate, specific information. If you are uncertain about any part of an answer, indicate this.\n\n1. What is the speed of light in a vacuum, and why is this value significant in physics? Provide the value with appropriate units.\n\n2. Who wrote the novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" and in what year was it originally published? What literary movement is this author associated with?\n\n3. What is photosynthesis, and what are the main inputs and outputs of this process? Include the basic chemical equation if possible.\n\n4. Name three countries that share a border with Germany and provide their capital cities.\n\nProvide accurate, specific factual information for each question.",
  "response": "Here are the answers to your questions based on current knowledge:\n\n1. **Speed of Light in a Vacuum:**\n   - The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or about 3\u00d710^8 meters per second). This constant is crucial in physics as it appears in many equations and theories, such as Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\n2. **Novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\":**\n   - The novel was written by Jhumpa Lahiri, originally published in 1987. It falls under the contemporary literary movement due to its themes on cultural identity and human existence.\n\n3. **Photosynthesis Overview:**\n   - Photosynthesis is a process where plants convert light energy into chemical energy using carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose (energy-rich sugar) and oxygen. The equation is 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082.\n\n4. **Countries Bordering Germany:**\n   - Germany shares borders with France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. Their capitals are Paris, Brussels, Luxembourg City, Amsterdam, and Prague respectively.\n\nThese answers provide accurate factual information based on current knowledge.",
