1. The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately \(299,792,458\) meters per second (\(m/s\)). This value is significant because it provides a fundamental constant in physics and serves as a basis for understanding the structure of space-time and interactions between particles at extremely high speeds.

2. Gabriel García Márquez wrote "One Hundred Years of Solitude." The novel was first published on September 6, 1967, in Colombia. Garcia Marquez is associated with the literary movement known as Magical Realism, which blends elements of fantasy and reality to explore complex social issues in Latin American culture.

3. Photosynthesis is a biological process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. It involves the uptake of carbon dioxide and water from their surroundings, using sunlight as an energy source through chlorophyll. The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis can be summarized as:
   \[6CO_2 + 6H_2O + Light Energy → C_6H_{12}O_6 (glucose) + 6O_2\]
This process is crucial in ecosystems, supporting the production of oxygen and the growth of plants.

4. Three countries that share a border with Germany are Austria, Switzerland, and Belgium. The capital cities of these nations are Vienna, Bern, and Brussels, respectively.
