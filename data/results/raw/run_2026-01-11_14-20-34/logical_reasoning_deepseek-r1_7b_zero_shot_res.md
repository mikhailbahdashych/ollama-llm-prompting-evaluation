**Answer:**

a) Yes, we can conclude that Maria takes calculated risks because premise 1 states all successful entrepreneurs take calculated risks, and premise 3 confirms Maria is a successful entrepreneur.

b) No, we cannot conclude Maria has failed in her ventures. Premise 2 only indicates some people who take calculated risks fail but doesn't specify if Maria is among them.

c) No, learning valuable lessons does not necessarily mean someone failed because premise 4 only states failing leads to learning, not that learning must come from failure.
