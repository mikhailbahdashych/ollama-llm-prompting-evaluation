**Answer:**

1. **Traditional View vs. New Perspective:**  
   Traditionally, scientists believed that the brain's structure was fixed after childhood, meaning it couldn't change once adulthood began. However, recent research indicates that the brain is adaptable throughout life, capable of forming and strengthening new neural connections.

2. **Evidence Supporting Neuroplasticity:**  
   - Adults learning a second language show increased gray matter in language-processing regions, demonstrating measurable structural changes.
   - Stroke patients undergoing intensive therapy regain lost functions as undamaged brain areas take over damaged roles, exemplifying adaptability.

3. **Limitations of Neuroplasticity:**  
   The potential for change is limited by factors such as age and the severity of injury, highlighting that adaptability isn't unlimited.
