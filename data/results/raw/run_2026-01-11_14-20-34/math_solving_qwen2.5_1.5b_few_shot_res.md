### Problem 1:
**Given:** The length (L) is 3 meters more than twice the width (W).

Let's denote the width by \( W \).
Therefore, the length \( L = 2W + 3 \).

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2(L + W) \]

Given that the perimeter \( P \) is 36 meters, we can write:
\[ 2((2W + 3) + W) = 36 \]
Simplify and solve for \( W \):
\[ 2(3W + 3) = 36 \]
\[ 6W + 6 = 36 \]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 6W = 30 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ W = 5 \]

Now find the length \( L \):
\[ L = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \]

So, the dimensions of the garden are:
- Width (W) = 5 meters
- Length (L) = 13 meters

### Problem 2:
**Given:** A jacket originally costs $120. First, it's discounted by 25%, and then an additional 10% is taken off the sale price.

First discount: \( \text{Discount} = 120 - (120 \times 0.25) \)
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 120 - 30 = 90 \]

Second discount: \( \text{Additional Discount} = 90 - (90 \times 0.10) \)
\[ \text{Final Price} = 90 - 9 = 81 \]

So, the final price of the jacket is:
- Final Price = $81

### Problem 3: Given \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 \), find \( f(4) \).

**Substitution and Calculation Steps:**

Calculate \( f(4) \):
\[ f(4) = 2(4)^2 - 5(4) + 3 \]

First, compute the squared term:
\[ (4)^2 = 16 \]
Then multiply by the coefficient of \( x^2 \):
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \]

Next, calculate the second part:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Now substitute back into the function and simplify:
\[ f(4) = 32 - 20 + 3 \]
\[ f(4) = 15 + 3 \]
\[ f(4) = 18 \]

So, \( f(4) = 18 \).

### Summary of Answers:

- **Problem 1:** Width = 5 meters, Length = 13 meters
- **Problem 2:** Final Price = $81
- **Problem 3:** \( f(4) = 18 \)
