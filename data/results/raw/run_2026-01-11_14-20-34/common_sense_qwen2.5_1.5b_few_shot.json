  "prompt": "This task evaluates the model's ability to apply everyday knowledge, practical reasoning, and common sense understanding of how the physical and social world works to solve realistic problems.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: Question: You need to know if milk in your refrigerator is still good to drink. The expiration date was 3 days ago. What should you do before drinking it?\nOutput: Before drinking the milk, you should:\n\n1. Smell it - sour milk has a distinct unpleasant odor\n2. Check its appearance - look for any discoloration or lumps\n3. If it passes those tests, taste a small amount\n\nThis is common sense because even though the expiration date was 3 days ago, milk can still be good if properly refrigerated, or it might have gone bad before the date if not stored correctly. The expiration date is a guideline, but your senses (smell, sight, taste) are reliable indicators of whether food is safe. Most people have learned through experience that sour milk smells and tastes bad, so checking before consuming is a practical safety measure.\nExplanation: This demonstrates common sense by combining knowledge of expiration dates (they're guidelines, not absolutes), understanding of food safety, and practical testing methods that anyone can perform.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: Question: Why do people typically check the weather forecast before planning an outdoor wedding?\nOutput: People check the weather forecast before planning an outdoor wedding because:\n\n1. Rain or storms would ruin an outdoor event, making guests uncomfortable and damaging decorations\n2. Extreme heat or cold affects guest comfort and safety\n3. Weather can't be controlled, but planning can be adjusted based on forecasts\n4. Having a backup plan (like a tent or indoor location) requires advance preparation\n\nThis is common sense because outdoor events are directly affected by weather conditions, and checking the forecast allows people to either choose a better date or prepare contingencies. It's much easier to prevent weather-related problems than to deal with them during the event. Most people have experienced being caught in unexpected rain and understand why advance planning matters.\nExplanation: This shows understanding of practical planning, cause-and-effect (weather affects outdoor activities), and why prevention is better than reaction in event planning.\n\nNow solve this:\nAnswer the following common sense reasoning questions. Explain your reasoning for each answer.\n\n1. Sarah left her ice cream on the kitchen counter and went to her room for 2 hours on a hot summer day. When she came back, what most likely happened to the ice cream? Why?\n\n2. Tom wants to hang a heavy picture frame on his wall. He has: a hammer, nails, tape, and glue. Which tool(s) should he use and why? What would happen if he used the wrong tool?\n\n3. Lisa is running late for an important meeting across town. She sees two routes: one is shorter (15 minutes) but goes through the city center during rush hour, the other is longer (25 minutes) but uses the highway. Which route should she choose and why? Consider what factors matter in this decision.\n\nProvide your answers with clear common sense reasoning.",
  "response": "Sure, let's break down each question for Sarah, Tom, and Lisa:\n\n### 1. Sarah left her ice cream on the kitchen counter and went to her room for 2 hours on a hot summer day. When she came back, what most likely happened to the ice cream? Why?\n\n**Answer:**\nThe most likely thing that happened to the ice cream is it melted completely.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- On a hot summer day, even with a closed kitchen door and no refrigerator nearby, the temperature outside can quickly warm up.\n- Sarah left for 2 hours, which could be quite long considering she was on a hot day. The heat would cause the ice cream to melt into liquid milk, not just partially thawing it.\n\n### 2. Tom wants to hang a heavy picture frame on his wall. He has: a hammer, nails, tape, and glue. Which tool(s) should he use and why? What would happen if he used the wrong tool?\n\n**Answer:**\nTom should use a hammer and nails to hang the picture frame.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- A hammer is necessary because it\u2019s an essential tool for breaking through nails or screw heads.\n- Nails are required because they securely hold up the heavy picture frame on the wall.\n\n### 3. Lisa is running late for an important meeting across town. She sees two routes: one is shorter (15 minutes) but goes through the city center during rush hour, the other is longer (25 minutes) but uses the highway. Which route should she choose and why? Consider what factors matter in this decision.\n\n**Answer:**\nLisa should choose to use the highway for her trip across town.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The highway typically offers faster travel times because it bypasses heavy traffic areas.\n- Rush hour on the city center road means longer travel time due to increased congestion and delays caused by heavier vehicles and people in the area.\n- By choosing the highway, she can save valuable time that might be needed for her meeting or further activities.\n\n### 3. Provide your answers with clear common sense reasoning.\n\n---\n\nThis approach of breaking down and explaining each step involves applying knowledge about how things behave under different conditions, which is what common-sense reasoning primarily entails.",
