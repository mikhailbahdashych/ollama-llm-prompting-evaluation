**Answer:**

1. **Traditional View and Change:**
   - Traditionally, scientists believed that the brain's structure was fixed after childhood, meaning it couldn't change much beyond early adulthood.
   - This view has changed to reflect the discovery that the brain remains highly adaptable throughout life, capable of forming new neural connections and strengthening existing ones through various experiences.

2. **Evidence Supporting Neuroplasticity:**
   - Adults learning a second language demonstrate measurable changes in brain structure, particularly increased gray matter in language-processing regions.
   - Stroke patients who undergo intensive therapy can sometimes regain lost functions as undamaged parts of the brain take over the roles previously held by damaged areas, providing direct evidence of neuroplasticity.

3. **Limitation of Neuroplasticity:**
   - The passage mentions that while the brain's ability to reorganize itself is significant, it is not limitless. Factors such as age and the severity of injury play crucial roles in determining how much the brain can change.
