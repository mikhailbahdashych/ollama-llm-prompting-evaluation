### Answer:

#### 1. According to the passage, what was the traditional scientific view of brain structure, and how has this view changed?

**Traditional Scientific View:**
The traditional scientific view on brain structure held that it was fixed after childhood, with neural pathways set in stone by early adulthood.

**Change:**
This view has shifted dramatically through research conducted over the past 30 years. The passage states:
- "For decades, scientists believed that the brain's structure was fixed after childhood, with neural pathways set in stone by early adulthood."

#### 2. What evidence does the passage provide to support the concept of neuroplasticity? Give specific examples.

**Examples:**
- **Adult Learning a Second Language:** 
  The passage mentions that adults learning a second language show measurable changes in brain structure:
  - "When we learn new skills, form memories, or recover from injury, our brains physically change by forming new neural connections and strengthening existing ones."

- **Stroke Patients:**
  Stroke patients can sometimes regain lost functions as undamaged parts of the brain take over roles previously held by damaged areas. The passage states:
  - "Similarly, stroke patients who engage in intensive therapy can sometimes regain lost functions as undamaged parts of the brain take over the roles of damaged areas."

#### 3. What limitation of neuroplasticity is mentioned in the passage?

**Limitation:**
The potential for change by the brain's reorganizing itself is not unlimited:
- **Age, Severity of Injury, and Other Factors:** 
  The text mentions that other factors such as age, severity of injury, and specific conditions play important roles. The passage states:
  - "However, research over the past thirty years has revealed that the brain remains remarkably adaptable throughout life."

Therefore, while neuroplasticity offers significant potential for change, it is not universally unlimited but depends on various external factors affecting both age and severity of injury.
