**Answer 1: Sarah's Ice Cream**

Sarah left her ice cream on the kitchen counter for two hours on a hot summer day. Most likely, the ice cream has melted because it was exposed to room temperature without proper refrigeration. Proteins in the ice cream begin to break down when exposed to heat and moisture, leading to spoilage after a short period of exposure.

**Answer 2: Tom Hanging Picture Frame**

Tom should use both the hammer and nails along with tape as a clamp for hanging the picture frame. The hammer is essential for driving nails into the wall, while the tape acts as an effective clamp to secure the frame in place before nail insertion, preventing it from shifting during the process.

If Tom uses only the hammer without a clamp (like tape), the frame might shift or damage itself due to improper alignment and potential movement during hammering. Similarly, using nails alone would not ensure the frame is securely held, risking damage or misalignment. Using glue instead of nails could lead to incorrect placement as well.

**Answer 3: Lisa's Route Decision**

Lisa should choose the longer route via the highway despite its longer distance because it offers better traffic conditions during rush hour compared to the city center. The shorter route through the city may result in significant delays due to heavy congestion, making the longer but less congested highway a more reliable option for timely arrival.

Factors considered: Traffic conditions on both routes, potential time saved versus added delays from traffic, and the need to arrive quickly despite longer distance.
