### Final Story

**The clock struck midnight, but time had stopped moving three hours ago.**

Ella sat in front of her phone, counting down the final moments until midnight. She was waiting for anything to happen – nothing ever did. This feeling of being stuck felt like a cruel joke on her life.

She couldn’t believe it when she heard her phone’s alarm go off at 12:00 AM. Ella looked at it and realized that time had stopped moving three hours ago, and the clock was still showing noon.

She got up to check what time it really was, only to find Dr. Lee sitting right beside her. He had been there for exactly three hours waiting with her.

“Ella,” he said in a low whisper, “I’ve always believed that time is relative. I thought we were just stuck because of some sort of malfunction.”

She turned around and realized everything she’d lost over the last hour: her job, her family’s care, even her passion for time travel. It was all gone.

But then they made a connection – a portal to their present selves. Ella felt an overwhelming sense of relief mixed with disbelief. How had they been stuck for so long? She couldn’t believe she’d actually lost that much in her life because of something as trivial as time.

They used the portal to return to where they were before, but everything was different now. They realized their lives weren't perfect without all those little things that happened every day, like waking up and making coffee or going for a walk with family members.

The lesson Ella learned from this experience: sometimes, life’s most important moments are missed because of the constant ticking of time. But when you stop to appreciate them, they’re worth it all.
