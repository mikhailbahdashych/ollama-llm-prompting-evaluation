**Problem 1:**

*Sarah is planning a rectangular garden where the length is 3 meters more than twice the width. The perimeter of the garden is 36 meters. What are the dimensions (length and width) of the garden?*

---

**Solution:**

Let's define:
- \( w \) = Width of the garden (in meters)
- \( l \) = Length of the garden

Given that the length is three meters more than twice the width, we can write:
\[
l = 2w + 3
\]

The perimeter (\( P \)) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2l + 2w
\]
We are told the perimeter is 36 meters. Substituting \( l \) from the first equation into the second:

\[
36 = 2(2w + 3) + 2w
\]

Simplify and solve for \( w \):
\[
36 = 4w + 6 + 2w \\
36 - 6 = 6w \\
30 = 6w \\
w = 5 \text{ meters}
\]

Now, find the length:
\[
l = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \text{ meters}
\]

**Answer:**
The width of the garden is **5 meters**, and the length is **13 meters**.

**Problem 2:**

*A store is having a sale. A jacket originally costs $120. First, it's discounted by 25%, and then an additional 10% is taken off the sale price. What is the final price of the jacket?*

---

**Solution:**

First Discount:
\[
\text{Discount Amount} = \frac{25}{100} \times \$120 = \$30
\]
\[
\text{Sale Price after 25% discount} = \$120 - \$30 = \$90
\]

Second Discount:
\[
\text{Additional Discount Amount} = \frac{10}{100} \times \$90 = \$9
\]
\[
\text{Final Price} = \$90 - \$9 = \$81
\]

**Answer:**
The final price of the jacket is **\$81**.

---

**Problem 3:**

*If \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 \), find \( f(4) \). Show your substitution and calculation steps.*

---

**Solution:**

To find \( f(4) \), substitute \( x = 4 \) into the function:
\[
f(4) = 2(4)^2 - 5(4) + 3
\]

Calculate each term step-by-step:
\[
2(4)^2 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \\
-5(4) = -20 \\
+3 = +3
\]
Now, add them together:
\[
f(4) = 32 - 20 + 3 = 15
\]

**Answer:**
\( f(4) = \boxed{15} \)
