Sure, let's break down each sentence and identify potential ambiguities and nuances:

### 1. "I saw the man with the telescope."
   - Ambiguity: The ambiguity arises from the placement of the relative pronoun "the". In English, it can be interpreted as:
     a) **With the telescope**: This suggests that someone else was using the telescope while you were looking at them.
     b) **The man with the telescope**: You are referring to the person who is wearing or holding the telescope.

   - Different possible meanings:
     1. "I saw the man with the telescope" (you see a particular man wearing a telescope).
     2. "I saw the man using a telescope" (someone else was looking at him through their own scope).

   - Likely interpretation: The first meaning is more likely if there’s context indicating you were observing another person or event where someone used a telescope.

### 2. "The chicken is ready to eat."
   - Ambiguity: The ambiguity arises from the verb "is" being placed at the beginning of the sentence, which makes it difficult to determine what is happening.
     - **Waiting for food**: It could mean that you are waiting for someone or something (e.g., a restaurant) to cook the chicken and serve it.
     - **Cooking**: This suggests that the chicken is being prepared by cooking.

   - Different possible meanings:
     1. "The chicken is ready to eat" (waiting for someone else).
     2. "The chicken is cooked/ready to eat" (preparing or cooking).

   - Likely interpretation: The second meaning is more likely if there's context indicating that the person is preparing food and expects it to be served.

### 3. "After months of practice, the pianist finally made her parents proud."
   - Implies about the situation before "months of practice":
     - **Practice**: There was a period of intense practice leading up to this moment.
     - **Painstaking effort**: The pianist put in significant time and dedication.

   - Nuance or subtext: This sentence suggests that while the achievement is significant, it wasn’t easy. It implies that patience and perseverance were key factors in reaching this milestone.

### Conclusion:
- Each sentence contains potential ambiguities due to different placements of relative pronouns/verbs.
- The correct interpretation often depends on additional context clues.
- For these examples, the second option (context) is more likely given standard English usage.
