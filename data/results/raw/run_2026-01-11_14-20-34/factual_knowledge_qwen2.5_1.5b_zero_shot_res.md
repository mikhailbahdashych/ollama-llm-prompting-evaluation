1. The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s) or about 670,616,629 miles per hour mph). This value is significant in physics because it sets the foundation for understanding many phenomena involving electromagnetic radiation and time dilation effects near massive objects.

2. Gabriel García Márquez wrote "One Hundred Years of Solitude." The novel was first published in 1967. Gabriel García Márquez is associated with the Latin American magical realism literary movement, which blends elements of fantasy and magic into realistic narratives.

3. Photosynthesis is a process used by plants to convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored within glucose (a type of sugar). The main inputs are carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and sunlight. The outputs include oxygen (O2) and glucose (C6H12O6).

The basic chemical equation for photosynthesis can be written as:
\[ 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + light \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \]

4. Three countries that share a border with Germany are Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Their capital cities are Vienna (Austria), Warsaw (Poland), and Prague (Czech Republic).
