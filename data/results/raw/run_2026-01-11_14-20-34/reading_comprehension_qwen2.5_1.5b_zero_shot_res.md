1. The traditional scientific view of brain structure held that after childhood, neural pathways were fixed and unchangeable by early adulthood. This view was based on the belief that once neurons fired during learning, they would cease to fire.

2. The passage provides several specific examples to support the concept of neuroplasticity:
   - Adults learning a second language show measurable changes in brain structure, with increased gray matter in language-processing regions.
   - Stroke patients who engage in intensive therapy can sometimes regain lost functions as undamaged parts of the brain take over the roles of damaged areas.

3. The passage mentions that while the potential for change is not unlimited and is influenced by factors such as age, severity of injury, and other individual differences, it does extend far beyond what was previously thought possible.
