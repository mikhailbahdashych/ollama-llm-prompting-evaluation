### Problem 1

**Step 1: Define Variables**
Let the width of Sarah's garden be \( w \) meters.
According to the problem, the length (\( l \)) is given by:
\[ l = 2w + 3 \]

**Step 2: Write the Perimeter Equation**
The perimeter (\( P \)) of a rectangle is calculated as:
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]
Given that \( P = 36 \) meters, we substitute \( l \):
\[ 36 = 2(2w + 3) + 2w \]

**Step 3: Simplify and Solve for \( w \)**
First simplify the equation:
\[ 36 = 4w + 6 + 2w \]
Combine like terms on the right side:
\[ 36 = 6w + 6 \]
Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with \( w \):
\[ 30 = 6w \]
Divide by 6 to solve for \( w \):
\[ w = 5 \] meters

**Step 4: Find Length (\( l \))**
Now that we have \( w = 5 \) meters, substitute back into the length equation:
\[ l = 2w + 3 \]
\[ l = 2(5) + 3 \]
\[ l = 10 + 3 \]
\[ l = 13 \] meters

**Step 5: Verify Perimeter**
Check the perimeter with \( w = 5 \) and \( l = 13 \):
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]
\[ P = 2(13) + 2(5) \]
\[ P = 26 + 10 \]
\[ P = 36 \] meters, which matches the given perimeter.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of Sarah's garden are length \( l = 13 \) meters and width \( w = 5 \) meters.

### Problem 2

**Step 1: Calculate Original Price**
The original price (\( P_{\text{orig}} \)) of the jacket is:
\[ P_{\text{orig}} = \$120 \]

**Step 2: Discount First by 25%**
A discount of 25% means the new price is:
\[ P_1 = P_{\text{orig}} - (P_{\text{orig}} \times 0.25) \]
\[ P_1 = \$120 - (\$120 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P_1 = \$120 - \$30 \]
\[ P_1 = \$90 \]

**Step 3: Discount Again by 10%**
A discount of 10% means the final price is:
\[ P_2 = P_1 - (P_1 \times 0.10) \]
\[ P_2 = \$90 - (\$90 \times 0.10) \]
\[ P_2 = \$90 - \$9 \]
\[ P_2 = \$81 \]

**Final Answer:**
The final price of the jacket is \( \$81 \).

### Problem 3

**Step 1: Substitute into Function Definition**

Given:
\[ f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 \]

We need to find \( f(4) \):
\[ f(4) = 2(4)^2 - 5(4) + 3 \]
\[ f(4) = 2(16) - 20 + 3 \]
\[ f(4) = 32 - 20 + 3 \]

**Step 2: Perform the Substitution and Calculation**
Combine like terms:
\[ f(4) = 8 + 3 \]
\[ f(4) = 11 \]

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( f(4) \) is \( 11 \).

### Summary

- **Problem 1**: Length \( l = 13 \) meters, Width \( w = 5 \) meters.
- **Problem 2**: Final price of the jacket is \( \$81 \).
- **Problem 3**: The value of \( f(4) \) is \( 11 \).
