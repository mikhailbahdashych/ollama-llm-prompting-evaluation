Sure! Let's go through each question one by one:

### 1. Sarah left her ice cream on the kitchen counter and went to her room for 2 hours on a hot summer day. When she came back, what most likely happened to the ice cream? Why?

**Reasoning:**
- Sarah is in the middle of a hot summer day.
- She has been gone from the kitchen for an extended period (2 hours).
- The kitchen counter where the ice cream was left is often a warm and humid environment.

Given these conditions, it's most likely that the ice cream melted due to heat exposure. Water-based items like ice cream are particularly susceptible to melting in hot environments because water evaporates easily at higher temperatures.

**Answer:** The ice cream melted.
- **Reasoning:** The hot weather combined with prolonged exposure to warm air and humidity caused the ice cream to melt. The combination of a heavy, water-rich substance like ice cream is especially prone to melting under such conditions.

### 2. Tom wants to hang a heavy picture frame on his wall. He has: a hammer, nails, tape, and glue. Which tool(s) should he use and why? What would happen if he used the wrong tool?

**Reasoning:**
- To secure the picture frame in place on the wall, Tom needs something that can hold the weight of the heavy frame.
- The correct tools are:
  - **Hammer**: For driving nails into the wall to create a sturdy base for the picture frame.
  - **Nails**: To fix the frame onto the wooden board where the nail holes have been pre-drilled.
  - **Tape (or Gorilla Glue)**: If glue is not an option, he can use tape or a strong adhesive like Gorilla Glue to secure the frame. Tape would be suitable for quick fixes but might not provide as much structural strength.

- The wrong tool:
  - **Glue**: This is not suited for hanging heavy picture frames. Even if Tom were to try using glue alone, it wouldn’t hold up against the weight of a large picture and could potentially cause damage to the wall or the frame.
  - **Hammer (without nails)**: While he could use a hammer, he would need additional tools like a screwdriver for pre-drilling holes in wooden surfaces. This approach is inefficient as it requires more steps.

**Answer:** Tom should use:
- A hammer and nails (for driving the picture frame into the wall).
- Glue or tape if nails are not available.
- **Reasoning:** Gluing alone won't hold up against the weight of a heavy picture frame, while using only a hammer would require additional tools like a screwdriver for pre-drilling holes. The hammer and nails method is more straightforward and effective.

### 3. Lisa is running late for an important meeting across town. She sees two routes: one is shorter (15 minutes) but goes through the city center during rush hour, the other is longer (25 minutes) but uses the highway. Which route should she choose and why? Consider what factors matter in this decision.

**Reasoning:**
- Lisa needs to reach her destination as quickly as possible for an important meeting.
- The primary factor influencing her choice is **time efficiency**.
- While the highway may be longer, it saves time by avoiding peak traffic hours during rush hour. Rush hour traffic can significantly increase travel times due to increased congestion.

Given that Lisa prioritizes reaching her destination on time and considering traffic patterns in her area, she should choose:
- The route using the highway because it avoids peak traffic periods and is likely faster overall.
- **Reasoning:** Despite the longer distance, the highway offers better time efficiency by reducing travel times during rush hour. This decision balances both speed and practicality for Lisa's urgent meeting.

### Summary:

1. Ice cream melted due to heat exposure in a warm kitchen environment.
2. Tom should use:
  - A hammer and nails
  - Glue or tape if nails are not available
3. Lisa should choose the route using the highway because it avoids peak traffic periods, providing better time efficiency despite being longer.

These answers demonstrate common sense reasoning by considering practical considerations of daily life, physical constraints (like weather conditions), and essential tools for different situations.
