Sure! Let's analyze the sentences one by one.

### Sentence 1: "I saw the man with the telescope."
- **Ambiguity and Nuances:** The ambiguity here lies in the specific action that takes place while observing someone with a telescope.
  
  - **Possible Meanings:**
    1. You witnessed the subject looking through the telescope.
    2. You observed the person as they were using the telescope.

- **Context Clues Analysis:**
  If context clues indicate you saw a man and he was holding or using a telescope, then the first interpretation is more likely.
  If there are no further context provided, both interpretations could be considered based on the general information that someone was looking through a telescope.

### Sentence 2: "The chicken is ready to eat."
- **Ambiguity:** The ambiguity here arises from the use of figurative language ("ready to eat") and an implied state (the chicken being cooked).

  - **Possible Meanings:**
    1. The chicken is completely prepared, ready for consumption.
    2. The subject believes the chicken has been adequately prepared or cooked.

- **Context Clues Analysis:**
  If the context suggests that the food is just being prepared and not yet finished cooking (e.g., "The chicken is still in the oven"), then the first interpretation is more likely.
  If there's no indication of when it was prepared, both interpretations could be considered based on a general understanding that something can be ready to eat.

### Sentence 3: "After months of practice, the pianist finally made her parents proud."
- **Implication about Before Months of Practice:** The sentence implies that prior to many months of practicing, there were no significant efforts or success in making her parents proud. This is an implication rather than a statement; it’s more subtle and context-driven.

  - **Possible Nuances:**
    1. There might have been periods where the pianist practiced but not successfully made her parents proud.
    2. The statement suggests that she had no efforts or practices leading to making her parents proud until recently, implying a significant change in her approach or practice methods.

- **Subtext or Interpretation:**
  Given context clues indicating that she started practicing months ago and then made her parents proud more recently, the nuance is most likely about the transformation of her method or efforts over time. This implies a shift from not making an effort to finally succeeding in pleasing her parents through her practice.

By analyzing these sentences, we can observe how subtle contextual clues influence interpretation and identify instances where ambiguity arises due to figurative language and context-dependent meanings.
